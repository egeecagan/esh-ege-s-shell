# esh - ege's shell

this is a shell implementation to understand how it\
is working under the hood. and few more feature by me.

---

## usage

to run it go inside build folder and use `cmake ..`\
after that there is a target called run in cmakelists.txt\
so basicly while you are in build folder do `make run`

---

this will be imlpemented in C.\
use command `help` for information.

## todo checler

i also did a program called todo checker it is for me to remember\
what to do sometimes i tell myself i will do this and forget it\
to check use `./todo` it only checks the file src/esh.c \
if you want to change it or take an input just use argv[1] as the \
argument.
